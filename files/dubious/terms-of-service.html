You agree that we may charge your payment account and that you will pay the applicable fees assessed to your account for the services you have purchased. Some services may start with a free trial. If you have (or someone in your company has) used those services previously, you may not be eligible to receive a free trial. We will not charge your account during the free trial period. Once the trial period has ended (unless you cancel the services prior to the end of the free trial period), we will charge your account the
                subscription fee at the beginning of your subscription and on a recurring basis thereafter until you cancel. You will not receive a notice from us that your trial period has ended. You must cancel your subscription before your billing period renews to avoid the billing of the next period's fees to your account. You will not receive a refund for any partial billing period cancellation.

            <h3 class="mb-4 mt-7 fw-bold">Subscription Credit Card Authorization</h3>

Pre-authorized charges on monthly accounts (beyond the first 30-day trial period) are non-refundable.

                Account credit is non-transferable. It will be removed and completely forfeited if your account is cancelled. All promotional coupon codes are for new customers only and cannot be applied to existing accounts. Any discounts that apply to "first year only" or "first month only" will be initially discounted at the advertised rate and subsequent charges will be at full retail price. By taking advantage of one of these types of discounts, you are pre-authorizing full price charges to your credit card on file for all payments except the "first".
            </p>
            <h3 class="mb-4 mt-7 fw-bold">Your Representations</h3>
            <p>

                legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this Agreement) and (ii) your use of the Services will be in strict accordance with this Agreement, the Dubious Privacy Policy, the applicable Acceptable Use Policy and all
                applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and the transmission of personal data to the United States from the country in
                which you reside) and will not infringe, violate or misappropriate the rights of any person or third party.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-4 mt-7 fw-bold">Termination</h3>
            <p>
                You can terminate your account at any time by deactivating your account or by providing notice of termination to us. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account or your access to any or all portions of the Services at any
                time, for any reason, including your violation or breach of any terms in this Agreement. Upon termination, all rights and licenses granted to you in this Agreement immediately end. If your account or access to our Services is terminated
                or suspended because you violated this Agreement, you will not be entitled to any refund of any fees nor will any fees be credited or reimbursed to you in any form and you will have no further right to access any of the foregoing or
                your account.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="mb-4 mt-7 fw-bold">Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
                If you cancel part way through a month, quarter, or year, you will retain account access until the end of the billing cycle. Once your subscription terminates, your account will move to a dormant state, and you will no longer be able to
                access the data associated with your account. You will not be charged again and no refunds will be given for the remaining paid-up time.
            </p>
            <p>There will be no refunds or credits for partial periods of service or refunds for months unused, nor can we append "un-used time" to your account should you wish to reactivate in the future.</p>
